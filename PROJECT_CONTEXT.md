## Original Prompt
```
Editorial-style website for a retro videogame universe.  
Tone: magazine / fanzine / underground press from the late 80s–90s.  
Visual style inspired by old gaming magazines, arcade flyers, CRT screens, pixel art, scanlines, halftone textures, bold typography, and imperfect layouts.

The website should feel like a curated editorial experience, not a product landing page.

Core sections:
- Hero section with a strong editorial headline, short manifesto-style intro, and retro visuals (pixel art, glitch effects, CRT glow).
- Feature articles / long-form posts about the game world, characters, lore, secrets, cheats, myths, and developer notes.
- Retro “columns” (reviews, tips & tricks, rumors, hidden levels, easter eggs).
- Image-heavy spreads with screenshots, pixel illustrations, and faux magazine layouts.
- Timeline or “history of the game” section styled like a printed magazine archive.
- Sound and music section highlighting chiptune / soundtrack inspiration.
- Footer styled like old magazine credits (editors, contributors, fake ads, issue number, year).

Design requirements:
- Bold, experimental grid (asymmetrical, magazine-like).
- Pixel or bitmap-inspired fonts mixed with strong editorial serif/sans for headlines.
- Limited retro color palette (neon accents, off-white backgrounds, deep blacks).
- Subtle animations: glitch, scanline flicker, hover effects that feel analog.
- Responsive but intentionally editorial (not overly minimal or corporate).

Tech:
- Modern web stack (Next.js).
- High-performance, SEO-friendly, accessible.
- Custom illustrations and imagery generated to match retro videogame aesthetics.

Overall feeling:
Like discovering a lost cult videogame magazine dedicated to a single iconic retro game — nostalgic, mysterious, stylish, and opinionated.
